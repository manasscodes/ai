# 📦 Data Structures in Python

This folder explores essential **Python Data Structures** with practice programs. Understanding these is vital for efficient coding, solving DSA problems, and building AI logic (e.g., queues for pipelines, dictionaries for model configs, etc.).

## 📘 Key Concepts

### ✅ Built-in Data Types

* `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`
* Mutable vs Immutable types

### ✅ Advanced Operations

* List/Dict comprehension
* Nested data structures
* Iteration and membership testing

### ✅ Stack & Queue Logic

* Stack = Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
* Queue = First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
* Implemented via `list`, `collections.deque` or `queue.Queue`

---

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python list_operations.py
```

## ✍️ Practice Tips

* Always test edge cases (empty list, duplicate keys)
* Try creating a data structure from real-world examples (ex: student DB)
* Use list/set/dict comprehension to simplify your code
