# 📊 Probability for AI — Fundamentals with Detailed Notes

Probability is the foundation of reasoning under uncertainty — a core component of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This guide provides an in-depth conceptual understanding of probability with real-world examples to build strong intuition, especially relevant to AI and data science.

## 📌 1. Introduction to Probability

**Probability** is a branch of mathematics that deals with **measuring the likelihood** of the occurrence of events.

- It ranges from **0 to 1**, where:
  - **0** means the event **cannot happen**
  - **1** means the event **is certain to happen**
  
The **classical definition** of probability (when outcomes are equally likely):

\[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\]

> **Example**: The probability of getting a 4 on a fair 6-sided die:  
> \[
> P(4) = \frac{1}{6}
> \]

## 📚 2. Sets and Probability

In probability theory, events are treated as **sets**. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes.

### 🔹 Basic Terminology

- **Sample Space (S)**: All possible outcomes of an experiment.
- **Event (E)**: A subset of the sample space.
- **Complement (E')**: Outcomes **not** in event E.
- **Union (A ∪ B)**: Either A **or** B or both occur.
- **Intersection (A ∩ B)**: Both A **and** B occur.
- **Null Set (∅)**: An event with **no** outcome.

> **Example**: Tossing a coin once  
> - Sample space: S = {H, T}  
> - Event A = {H}  
> - Complement A' = {T}  
> - P(A) = 0.5

## 🎯 3. Fair Events

An event is **fair** when **all outcomes are equally likely**.

> **Example**: A fair 6-sided die has equal probability for all outcomes  
> \[
> P(i) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, ..., 6
> \]

In real-world data, fairness can also refer to **unbiasedness** in model training, sampling, or testing.

## 🔄 4. Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is the probability of an event **given** that another event has occurred.

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \quad \text{provided } P(B) > 0
\]

> **Example**:  
> From a deck of 52 cards, what is the probability that a card is a **King**, given that it is a **face card**?  
> - Face cards = J, Q, K → 12 total  
> - Kings = 4  
> So,
> \[
> P(King | Face) = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}
> \]

## 🔗 5. Independent vs. Mutually Exclusive Events

### ✅ Independent Events

Two events A and B are **independent** if the occurrence of one does **not affect** the other:

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
\]

> **Example**: Tossing a coin and rolling a die  
> - P(Heads) = 0.5, P(3 on die) = 1/6  
> - P(H ∩ 3) = 0.5 × 1/6 = 1/12

### ❌ Mutually Exclusive Events

Events A and B are **mutually exclusive** (disjoint) if **they cannot occur at the same time**:

\[
P(A \cap B) = 0
\]

> **Example**: Drawing a card: A = {Even number}, B = {Odd number}  
> - P(A ∩ B) = 0

**Important**:  
- **Mutually exclusive ≠ Independent**  
- Mutually exclusive events are **dependent** (if one occurs, the other definitely cannot)

## 📐 6. Bayes’ Theorem

Bayes' theorem helps **reverse conditional probabilities**, crucial for decision-making and inference in AI.

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \): Posterior probability
- \( P(B | A) \): Likelihood
- \( P(A) \): Prior
- \( P(B) \): Evidence or marginal likelihood

> **Example (Medical diagnosis)**:  
> Suppose:
> - P(Disease) = 0.01  
> - P(Positive test | Disease) = 0.99  
> - P(Positive test | No disease) = 0.05  
> - P(No disease) = 0.99
>
> Calculate P(Disease | Positive test):  
> \[
> P(Positive) = (0.99 × 0.01) + (0.05 × 0.99) = 0.0594  
> \]
> \[
> P(Disease | Positive) = \frac{0.99 × 0.01}{0.0594} ≈ 0.1667
> \]
> So, even with a positive test, only a ~16.7% chance of having the disease.

Bayes' theorem forms the **backbone of many AI models**, such as **Naive Bayes classifiers**, **Bayesian Networks**, and **Bayesian inference**.

## 🔁 Extra Practice Examples

1. A bag contains 3 red, 5 blue, and 2 green balls. What is the probability of drawing:
   - A red ball?
   - A blue or green ball?
   - A red ball, given it is not blue?

2. A student is known to solve 75% of the problems correctly. What is the probability that:
   - They solve a problem correctly?
   - Two problems in a row?

3. If a person tests positive for a rare disease with a 98% accuracy, and the disease affects 0.1% of the population, what is the probability they actually have it?
