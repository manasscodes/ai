## Introduction to NumPy

**NumPy** stands for **Numerical Python** and is one of the most useful scientific libraries in Python programming. It provides support for large multidimensional array objects and various tools to work with them efficiently. NumPy is known for its high performance and provides efficient storage and data operations as arrays grow in size.

---

## Installation & Import

NumPy comes pre-installed with Anaconda. But if you want to install NumPy separately on your machine, just type the below command on your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Now you need to import the library:

```python
import numpy as np
```

`np` is the de facto abbreviation for NumPy used by the data science community.

## Python Lists vs NumPy Arrays

### Theory

If youâ€™re familiar with Python, you might be wondering why use NumPy arrays when we already have Python lists? After all, these Python lists act as an array that can store elements of various types. This is a perfectly valid question and the answer to this is hidden in the way Python stores an object in memory.

A Python object is actually a pointer to a memory location that stores all the details about the object, like bytes and the value. Although this extra information is what makes Python a dynamically typed language, it also comes at a cost which becomes apparent when storing a large collection of objects, like in an array.

Python lists are essentially an array of pointers, each pointing to a location that contains the information related to the element. This adds a lot of overhead in terms of memory and computation. And most of this information is rendered redundant when all the objects stored in the list are of the same type!

To overcome this problem, we use NumPy arrays that contain only homogeneous elements, i.e. elements having the same data type. This makes it more efficient at storing and manipulating the array. This difference becomes apparent when the array has a large number of elements, say thousands or millions. Also, with NumPy arrays, you can perform element-wise operations, something which is not possible using Python lists!

This is the reason why NumPy arrays are preferred over Python lists when performing mathematical operations on a large amount of data.

## Creating NumPy Arrays

NumPy arrays are called **ndarray** or N-dimensional arrays and they store elements of the same type and size.

### Basic ndarray

NumPy arrays are very easy to create given the complex problems they solve. To create a very basic ndarray, you use the `np.array()` method. All you have to pass are the values of the array as a list:

```python
np.array([1,2,3,4])
# Output:
# array([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

This array contains integer values. You can specify the type of data in the `dtype` argument:

```python
np.array([1,2,3,4],dtype=np.float32)
# Output:
# array([1., 2., 3., 4.], dtype=float32)
```

Since NumPy arrays can contain only homogeneous data types, values will be upcast if the types do not match:

```python
np.array([1,2.0,3,4])
# Output:
# array([1., 2., 3., 4.])
```

Here, NumPy has upcast integer values to float values.

NumPy arrays can be multi-dimensional:

```python
np.array([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]])
# Output:
# array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
#        [5, 6, 7, 8]])
```

> **Note:** A matrix is just a rectangular array of numbers with shape N x M where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns in the matrix. The one you just saw above is a 2 x 4 matrix.

### Array of Zeros

NumPy lets you create an array of all zeros using the `np.zeros()` method. All you have to do is pass the shape of the desired array:

```python
np.zeros(5)
# Output: array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])

np.zeros((2,3))
# Output:
# array([[0., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 0.]])
```

### Array of Ones

You could also create an array of all 1s using the `np.ones()` method:

```python
np.ones(5,dtype=np.int32)
# Output: array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
```

### Random Arrays

Another very commonly used method to create ndarrays is `np.random.rand()` method. It creates an array of a given shape with random values from [0,1):

```python
np.random.rand(2,3)
# Output: array([[..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...]])  # Random values in [0, 1)
```

### Array of a Given Value

Or, in fact, you can create an array filled with any given value using the `np.full()` method. Just pass in the shape of the desired array and the value you want:

```python
np.full((2,2),7)
# Output:
# array([[7, 7],
#        [7, 7]])
```

### Identity Matrix

Another great method is `np.eye()` that returns an array with 1s along its diagonal and 0s everywhere else. An Identity matrix is a square matrix that has 1s along its main diagonal and 0s everywhere else.

```python
np.eye(3)
# Output:
# array([[1., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 1., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 1.]])
```

> **Note:** A square matrix has an N x N shape. This means it has the same number of rows and columns.

### Evenly Spaced Arrays

You can quickly get an evenly spaced array of numbers using the `np.arange()` method:

```python
np.arange(5)
# Output: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

np.arange(2,10,2)
# Output: array([2, 4, 6, 8])
```

The start, end and step size of the interval of values can be explicitly defined by passing in three numbers as arguments for these values respectively. A point to be noted here is that the interval is defined as [start,end) where the last number will not be included in the array.

Another similar function is `np.linspace()`, but instead of step size, it takes in the number of samples that need to be retrieved from the interval. A point to note here is that the last number is included in the values returned unlike in the case of `np.arange()`.

```python
np.linspace(0,1,5)
# Output: array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  ])
```

---

## Array Attributes

Once you have created your ndarray, the next thing you would want to do is check the number of axes, shape, and the size of the ndarray.

### Dimensions

You can easily determine the number of dimensions or axes of a NumPy array using the `ndim` attribute:

```python
a = np.array([[5,10,15],[20,25,20]])
print('Array :','\n',a)
print('Dimensions :','\n',a.ndim)
# Output:
# Array :
# [[ 5 10 15]
#  [20 25 20]]
# Dimensions :
# 2
```

This array has two dimensions: 2 rows and 3 columns.

### Shape

The shape is an attribute of the NumPy array that shows how many rows of elements are there along each dimension. You can further index the shape so returned by the ndarray to get value along each dimension:

```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
print('Array :','\n',a)
print('Shape :','\n',a.shape)
print('Rows = ',a.shape[0])
print('Columns = ',a.shape[1])
# Output:
# Array :
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]]
# Shape :
# (2, 3)
# Rows = 2
# Columns = 3
```

### Size

You can determine how many values there are in the array using the `size` attribute. It just multiplies the number of rows by the number of columns in the ndarray:

```python
a = np.array([[5,10,15],[20,25,20]])
print('Size of array :',a.size)
print('Manual determination of size of array :',a.shape[0]*a.shape[1])
# Output:
# Size of array : 6
# Manual determination of size of array : 6
```

---

## Reshaping, Flattening, and Transposing

### Reshaping

Reshaping a ndarray can be done using the `np.reshape()` method. It changes the shape of the ndarray without changing the data within the ndarray:

```python
a = np.array([3,6,9,12])
np.reshape(a,(2,2))
# Output:
# array([[ 3, 6],
#        [ 9, 12]])
```

Here, I reshaped the ndarray from a 1-D to a 2-D ndarray.

While reshaping, if you are unsure about the shape of any of the axis, just input -1. NumPy automatically calculates the shape when it sees a -1:

```python
a = np.array([3,6,9,12,18,24])
print('Three rows :','\n',np.reshape(a,(3,-1)))
print('Three columns :','\n',np.reshape(a,(-1,3)))
# Output:
# Three rows :
# [[ 3  6]
#  [ 9 12]
#  [18 24]]
# Three columns :
# [[ 3  6  9]
#  [12 18 24]]
```

### Flattening

Sometimes when you have a multidimensional array and want to collapse it to a single-dimensional array, you can either use the `flatten()` method or the `ravel()` method:

```python
a = np.ones((2,2))
b = a.flatten()
c = a.ravel()
print('Original shape :', a.shape)
print('Array :','\n', a)
print('Shape after flatten :',b.shape)
print('Array :','\n', b)
print('Shape after ravel :',c.shape)
print('Array :','\n', c)
# Output:
# Original shape : (2, 2)
# Array :
# [[1. 1.]
#  [1. 1.]]
# Shape after flatten : (4,)
# Array :
# [1. 1. 1. 1.]
# Shape after ravel : (4,)
# Array :
# [1. 1. 1. 1.]
```

#### Deep vs Shallow Copy

But an important difference between `flatten()` and `ravel()` is that the former returns a **copy** of the original array while the latter returns a **reference** to the original array. This means any changes made to the array returned from `ravel()` will also be reflected in the original array while this will not be the case with `flatten()`.

```python
b[0] = 0
print(a)
# Output:
# [[1. 1.]
#  [1. 1.]]

c[0] = 0
print(a)
# Output:
# [[0. 1.]
#  [1. 1.]]
```

What is happening here is that `flatten()` creates a **Deep copy** of the ndarray while `ravel()` creates a **Shallow copy** of the ndarray. Deep copy means that a completely new ndarray is created in memory and the ndarray object returned by `flatten()` is now pointing to this memory location. Therefore, any changes made here will not be reflected in the original ndarray. A Shallow copy, on the other hand, returns a reference to the original memory location. Meaning the object returned by `ravel()` is pointing to the same memory location as the original ndarray object. So, definitely, any changes made to this ndarray will also be reflected in the original ndarray too.

### Transpose

Another very interesting reshaping method of NumPy is the `transpose()` method. It takes the input array and swaps the rows with the column values, and the column values with the values of the rows:

```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
b = np.transpose(a)
print('Original','\n','Shape',a.shape,'\n',a)
print('Expand along columns:','\n','Shape',b.shape,'\n',b)
# Output:
# Original
# Shape (2, 3)
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]]
# Expand along columns:
# Shape (3, 2)
# [[1 4]
#  [2 5]
#  [3 6]]
```

On transposing a 2 x 3 array, we got a 3 x 2 array. Transpose has a lot of significance in linear algebra.

### Expanding and Squeezing

You can add a new axis to an array using the `expand_dims()` method by providing the array and the axis along which to expand:

```python
a = np.array([1,2,3])
b = np.expand_dims(a,axis=0)
c = np.expand_dims(a,axis=1)
print('Original:','\n','Shape',a.shape,'\n',a)
print('Expand along columns:','\n','Shape',b.shape,'\n',b)
print('Expand along rows:','\n','Shape',c.shape,'\n',c)
# Output:
# Original:
# Shape (3,)
# [1 2 3]
# Expand along columns:
# Shape (1, 3)
# [[1 2 3]]
# Expand along rows:
# Shape (3, 1)
# [[1]
#  [2]
#  [3]]
```

---

## Indexing and Slicing

So far, we have seen how to create a NumPy array and how to play around with its shape. In this section, we will see how to extract specific values from the array using indexing and slicing.

### Slicing 1-D NumPy arrays

Slicing means retrieving elements from one index to another index. All we have to do is to pass the starting and ending point in the index like this: `[start: end]`. However, you can even take it up a notch by passing the step-size. What is that? Well, suppose you wanted to print every other element from the array, you would define your step-size as 2, meaning get the element 2 places away from the present index.

Incorporating all this into a single index would look something like this: `[start:end:step-size]`.

```python
a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6])
print(a[1:5:2])
# Output: [2 4]
```

Notice that the last element did not get considered. This is because slicing includes the start index but excludes the end index. A way around this is to write the next higher index to the final index value you want to retrieve:

```python
a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6])
print(a[1:6:2])
# Output: [2 4 6]
```

If you donâ€™t specify the start or end index, it is taken as 0 or array size, respectively, as default. And the step-size by default is 1.

```python
a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6])
print(a[:6:2])
print(a[1::2])
print(a[1:6:])
# Output:
# [1 3 5]
# [2 4 6]
# [2 3 4 5 6]
```

### Slicing 2-D NumPy arrays

Now, a 2-D array has rows and columns so it can get a little tricky to slice 2-D arrays. But once you understand it, you can slice any dimension array!

Before learning how to slice a 2-D array, letâ€™s have a look at how to retrieve an element from a 2-D array:

```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
print(a[0,0])
print(a[1,2])
print(a[1,0])
# Output:
# 1
# 6
# 4
```

Here, we provided the row value and column value to identify the element we wanted to extract. While in a 1-D array, we were only providing the column value since there was only 1 row.

So, to slice a 2-D array, you need to mention the slices for both, the row and the column:

```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
# print first row values
print('First row values :','\n',a[0:1,:])
# with step-size for columns
print('Alternate values from first row:','\n',a[0:1,::2])
#
print('Second column values :','\n',a[:,1::2])
print('Arbitrary values :','\n',a[0:1,1:3])
# Output:
# First row values :
# [[1 2 3]]
# Alternate values from first row:
# [[1 3]]
# Second column values :
# [[2]
#  [5]]
# Arbitrary values :
# [[2 3]]
```

### Slicing 3-D NumPy arrays

So far we havenâ€™t seen a 3-D array. Letâ€™s first visualize how a 3-D array looks like:

```python
a = np.array([[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]],
[[7,8],[9,10],[11,12]],
[[13,14],[15,16],[17,18]]])
# 3-D array
print(a)
# Output:
# [[[ 1 2]
#   [ 3 4]
#   [ 5 6]]
#  [[ 7 8]
#   [ 9 10]
#   [11 12]]
#  [[13 14]
#   [15 16]
#   [17 18]]]
```

In addition to the rows and columns, as in a 2-D array, a 3-D array also has a depth axis where it stacks one 2-D array behind the other. So, when you are slicing a 3-D array, you also need to mention which 2-D array you are slicing. This usually comes as the first value in the index:

```python
# value
print('First array, first row, first column value :','\n',a[0,0,0])
print('First array last column :','\n',a[0,:,1])
print('First two rows for second and third arrays :','\n',a[1:,0:2,0:2])
# Output:
# First array, first row, first column value :
# 1
# First array last column :
# [2 4 6]
# First two rows for second and third arrays :
# [[[ 7 8]
#   [ 9 10]]
#  [[13 14]
#   [15 16]]]

print('Printing as a single array :','\n',a[1:,0:2,0:2].flatten())
# Output:
# Printing as a single array :
# [ 7 8 9 10 13 14 15 16]
```

### Negative slicing of NumPy arrays

An interesting way to slice your array is to use negative slicing. Negative slicing prints elements from the end rather than the beginning. Have a look below:

```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],
[6,7,8,9,10]])
print(a[:,-1])
# Output: [ 5 10]
```

Here, the last values for each row were printed. If, however, we wanted to extract from the end, we would have to explicitly provide a negative step-size otherwise the result would be an empty list.

```python
print(a[:,-1:-3:-1])
# Output:
# [[ 5 4]
#  [10 9]]
```

Having said that, the basic logic of slicing remains the same, i.e. the end index is never included in the output.

An interesting use of negative slicing is to reverse the original array.

```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],
[6,7,8,9,10]])
print('Original array :','\n',a)
print('Reversed array :','\n',a[::-1,::-1])
# Output:
# Original array :
# [[ 1 2 3 4 5]
#  [ 6 7 8 9 10]]
# Reversed array :
# [[10 9 8 7 6]
#  [ 5 4 3 2 1]]
```

You can also use the `flip()` method to reverse an ndarray.

```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],
[6,7,8,9,10]])
print('Original array :','\n',a)
print('Reversed array vertically :','\n',np.flip(a,axis=1))
print('Reversed array horizontally :','\n',np.flip(a,axis=0))
# Output:
# Original array :
# [[ 1 2 3 4 5]
#  [ 6 7 8 9 10]]
# Reversed array vertically :
# [[ 5 4 3 2 1]
#  [10 9 8 7 6]]
# Reversed array horizontally :
# [[ 6 7 8 9 10]
#  [ 1 2 3 4 5]]
```

---

## Stacking and Concatenating NumPy arrays

You can create a new array by combining existing arrays. This you can do in two ways:

- Either combine the arrays vertically (i.e. along the rows) using the `vstack()` method, thereby increasing the number of rows in the resulting array
- Or combine the arrays in a horizontal fashion (i.e. along the columns) using the `hstack()`, thereby increasing the number of columns in the resultant array

```python
a = np.arange(0,5)
b = np.arange(5,10)
print('Array 1 :','\n',a)
print('Array 2 :','\n',b)
print('Vertical stacking :','\n',np.vstack((a,b)))
print('Horizontal stacking :','\n',np.hstack((a,b)))
# Output:
# Array 1 :
# [0 1 2 3 4]
# Array 2 :
# [5 6 7 8 9]
# Vertical stacking :
# [[0 1 2 3 4]
#  [5 6 7 8 9]]
# Horizontal stacking :
# [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
```

A point to note here is that the axis along which you are combining the array should have the same size otherwise you are bound to get an error!

While stacking arrays is one way of combining old arrays to get a new one, you could also use the `concatenate()` method where the passed arrays are joined along an existing axis:

```python
a = np.arange(0,5).reshape(1,5)
b = np.arange(5,10).reshape(1,5)
print('Array 1 :','\n',a)
print('Array 2 :','\n',b)
print('Concatenate along rows :','\n',np.concatenate((a,b),axis=0))
print('Concatenate along columns :','\n',np.concatenate((a,b),axis=1))
# Output:
# Array 1 :
# [[0 1 2 3 4]]
# Array 2 :
# [[5 6 7 8 9]]
# Concatenate along rows :
# [[0 1 2 3 4]
#  [5 6 7 8 9]]
# Concatenate along columns :
# [[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]]
```

The drawback of this method is that the original array must have the axis along which you want to combine. Otherwise, get ready to be greeted by an error.

Another very useful function is the `append` method that adds new elements to the end of a ndarray. This is obviously useful when you already have an existing ndarray but want to add new values to it.

```python
# append values to ndarray
a = np.array([[1,2],
[3,4]])
np.append(a,[[5,6]], axis=0)
# Output:
# array([[1, 2],
#        [3, 4],
#        [5, 6]])
```

## Broadcasting in NumPy arrays â€“ A class apart!

Broadcasting is one of the best features of ndarrays. It lets you perform arithmetics operations between ndarrays of different sizes or between an ndarray and a simple number!

Broadcasting essentially stretches the smaller ndarray so that it matches the shape of the larger ndarray:

```python
a = np.arange(10,20,2)
b = np.array([[2],[2]])
print('Adding two different size arrays :','\n',a+b)
print('Multiplying an ndarray and a number :',a*2)
# Output:
# Adding two different size arrays :
# [[12 14 16 18 20]
#  [12 14 16 18 20]]
# Multiplying an ndarray and a number : [20 24 28 32 36]
```

Its working can be thought of like stretching or making copies of the scalar, the number, [2, 2, 2] to match the shape of the ndarray and then perform the operation element-wise. But no such copies are being made. It is just a way of thinking about how broadcasting is working.

This is very useful because it is more efficient to multiply an array with a scalar value rather than another array! It is important to note that two ndarrays can broadcast together only when they are compatible.

**Ndarrays are compatible when:**

1. Both have the same dimensions
2. Either of the ndarrays has a dimension of 1. The one having a dimension of 1 is broadcast to meet the size requirements of the larger ndarray

In case the arrays are not compatible, you will get a ValueError.

```python
a = np.ones((3,3))
b = np.array([2])
a+b
# Output:
# array([[3., 3., 3.],
#        [3., 3., 3.],
#        [3., 3., 3.]])
```

Here, the second ndarray was stretched, hypothetically, to a 3 x 3 shape, and then the result was calculated.

## NumPy Ufuncs â€“ The secret of its success!

Python is a dynamically typed language. This means the data type of a variable does not need to be known at the time of the assignment. Python will automatically determine it at run-time. While this means a cleaner and easier code to write, it also makes Python sluggish.

This problem manifests itself when Python has to do many operations repeatedly, like the addition of two arrays. This is so because each time an operation needs to be performed, Python has to check the data type of the element. This problem is overcome by NumPy using the ufuncs function.

The way NumPy makes this work faster is by using **vectorization**. Vectorization performs the same operation on ndarray in an element-by-element fashion in a compiled code. So the data types of the elements do not need to be determined every time, thereby performing faster operations.

**ufuncs** are Universal functions in NumPy that are simply mathematical functions. They perform fast element-wise functions. They are called automatically when you are performing simple arithmetic operations on NumPy arrays because they act as wrappers for NumPy ufuncs.

For example, when adding two NumPy arrays using `+`, the NumPy ufunc `add()` is automatically called behind the scene and quietly does its magic:

```python
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = [6,7,8,9,10]
%timeit a+b

a = np.arange(1,6)
b = np.arange(6,11)
%timeit a+b
```

You can see how the same addition of two arrays has been done in significantly less time with the help of NumPy ufuncs!

---

## Maths with NumPy arrays

Here are some of the most important and useful operations that you will need to perform on your NumPy array.

### Basic arithmetic operations on NumPy arrays

The basic arithmetic operations can easily be performed on NumPy arrays. The important thing to remember is that these simple arithmetics operation symbols just act as wrappers for NumPy ufuncs.

```python
print('Subtract :',a-5)
print('Multiply :',a*5)
print('Divide :',a/5)

## Aggregation Functions

### Mean, Median and Standard deviation

To find the mean and standard deviation of a NumPy array, use the `mean()`, `std()` and `median()` methods:

```python
a = np.arange(5,15,2)
print('Mean :',np.mean(a))
print('Standard deviation :',np.std(a))
print('Median :',np.median(a))
# Output:
# Mean : 9.0
# Standard deviation : 2.8284271247461903
# Median : 9.0
```

### Min-Max values and their indexes

Min and Max values in an ndarray can be easily found using the `min()` and `max()` methods:

```python
a = np.array([[1,6],
[4,3]])
# minimum along a column
print('Min :',np.min(a,axis=0))
# maximum along a row
print('Max :',np.max(a,axis=1))
# Output:
# Min : [1 3]
# Max : [6 4]
```

You can also easily determine the index of the minimum or maximum value in the ndarray along a particular axis using the `argmin()` and `argmax()` methods:

```python
a = np.array([[1,6,5],
[4,3,7]])
# minimum along a column
print('Min :',np.argmin(a,axis=0))
# maximum along a row
print('Max :',np.argmax(a,axis=1))
# Output:
# Min : [0 1 0]
# Max : [1 2]
```

Let me break down the output for you. The minimum value for the first column is the first element along the column. For the second column, it is the second element. And for the third column, it is the first element. You can similarly determine what the output for maximum values indicates.

### Sorting in NumPy arrays

For any programmer, the time complexity of any algorithm is of prime essence. Sorting is an important and very basic operation that you might well use on a daily basis as a data scientist. So, it is important to use a good sorting algorithm with minimum time complexity.

The NumPy library is a legend when it comes to sorting elements of an array. It has a range of sorting functions that you can use to sort your array elements. It has implemented quicksort, heapsort, mergesort, and timesort for you under the hood when you use the `sort()` method:

```python
a = np.array([1,4,2,5,3,6,8,7,9])
np.sort(a, kind='quicksort')
# Output:
# array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
```

You can even sort the array along any axis you desire:

```python
a = np.array([[5,6,7,4],
[9,2,3,7]])# sort along the column
print('Sort along column :','\n',np.sort(a, kind='mergresort',axis=1))
# sort along the row
print('Sort along row :','\n',np.sort(a, kind='mergresort',axis=0))
# Output:
# Sort along column :
# [[4 5 6 7]
#  [2 3 7 9]]
# Sort along row :
# [[5 2 3 4]
#  [9 6 7 7]]
```

## Min and Max Function in Numpy

```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[3,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print("The array is: ")
print(arr)
print("\n")
print("Min value is: ")
print(np.min(arr))
print("\n")
print("Max value is: ")
print(np.max(arr))
# Output:
# The array is:
# [[3 5 6]
#  [7 8 9]]
# Min value is:
# 3
# Max value is:
# 9
```

## Finding the Median in Numpy

Median function in numpy is used for finding the median of the array. Letâ€™s look at an example to find out about it:

```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[10,20,30],[40,50,60],[70,80,90]])
print("The array is: ")
print(arr)
print("\n")
print("Median function applied: ")
print(np.median(arr))
# Output:
# The array is:
# [[10 20 30]
#  [40 50 60]
#  [70 80 90]]
# Median function applied:
# 50.0
```

## Finding the Mean in Numpy

The mean function in numpy is used for calculating the mean of the elements present in the array. You can calculate the mean by using the axis number as well but it only depends on a special case, normally if you want to find out the mean of the whole array then you should use the simple `np.mean()` function. For example:

```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[10,20,30],[40,50,60],[70,80,99]])
print("The array is: ")
print(arr)
print("\n")
print("Mean function applied: ")
print(np.mean(arr))
print("Mean function applied on axis 1: ")
print(np.mean(arr, axis=1))
# Output:
# The array is:
# [[10 20 30]
#  [40 50 60]
#  [70 80 99]]
# Mean function applied:
# 51.0
# Mean function applied on axis 1:
# [20. 50. 83.]
```

## Finding Standard Deviation in Numpy

You can find out the standard deviation of an array using the `std()` function, for example:

```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([10,20,30])
print("The standard deviation of the array is: ")
print(np.std(arr))
# Output:
# The standard deviation of the array is:
# 8.16496580927726
```

## Finding Variance in Numpy

As you may or may not know, that variance is the mean (average) of squared deviations, and in order to calculate the variance in numpy we use the `var()` function.

```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([10,20,30])
print("The variance of the array is: ")
print(np.var(arr))
# Output:
# The variance of the array is:
# 66.66666666666667
```

## NumPy arrays and Images

NumPy arrays find wide use in storing and manipulating image data. But what is image data really?

Images are made up of pixels that are stored in the form of an array. Each pixel has a value ranging between 0 to 255 â€“ 0 indicating a black pixel and 255 indicating a white pixel. A colored image consists of three 2-D arrays, one for each of the color channels: Red, Green, and Blue, placed back-to-back thus making a 3-D array. Each value in the array constitutes a pixel value. So, the size of the array depends on the number of pixels along each dimension.

Python can read the image as an array using the `scipy.misc.imread()` method in the SciPy library. And when we output it, it is simply a 3-D array containing the pixel values:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import misc
# read image
im = misc.imread('./original.jpg')
# image
im
# Output:
# array([[[115, 106, 67],
#         [113, 104, 65],
#         ...],
#        ...])
```

We can check the shape and type of this NumPy array:

```python
print(im.shape)
print(type(im))
# Output:
# (561, 997, 3)
# <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

Now, since an image is just an array, we can easily manipulate it using an array function that we have looked at in the article. Like, we could flip the image horizontally using the `np.flip()` method:

```python
# flip
plt.imshow(np.flip(im, axis=1))
```

Or you could normalize or change the range of values of the pixels. This is sometimes useful for faster computations.

```python
im/255
# Output:
# array([[[0.45098039, 0.41568627, 0.2627451 ],
#         ...],
#        ...])
```
