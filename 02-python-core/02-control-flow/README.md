## 🔄 Control Flow Topics

### ✅ If-Else Statements

* Basic conditional logic
* Nested `if` and `if-elif-else`

### ✅ Loops

* `for` loops for iteration
* `while` loops for condition-based execution

### ✅ Loop Control Statements

* `break`: exit the loop
* `continue`: skip current iteration
* `pass`: placeholder statement

### ✅ Nested Loops

* Loop inside another loop
* Useful for pattern printing, matrix operations

## 🧪 How to Run

Each program is executable directly:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Example:

```bash
python fibonacci_series.py
```

---

## ✍️ Practice Strategy

* Try solving each program **without looking at the answer first**
* Experiment with changing values/conditions
* Add your own variations after completing each program
