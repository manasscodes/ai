# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This folder focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — a crucial paradigm for writing modular, reusable, and scalable code in AI systems, APIs, and production-grade software.

OOP is essential for building AI agents, reusable models, and backend logic in real-world applications.

## 🔧 Core OOP Concepts

### ✅ Class & Object

* Blueprint and instance representation

### ✅ `__init__()` Constructor

* Automatically called when object is created

### ✅ `self` Keyword

* Represents instance of the class

### ✅ Inheritance

* Reuse parent class attributes/methods in child class

### ✅ Encapsulation

* Hiding internal details using private/protected members

### ✅ Polymorphism

* One interface, many forms (function/method overloading)

### ✅ Class vs Instance Variables

* Shared vs individual variable space

---

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python inheritance_example.py
```

## ✍️ Practice Tips

* Model real-world entities (Car, BankAccount, etc.)
* Build small apps using classes (Calculator, ChatBot, Library)
* Use class structure to prep for backend/API logic later
