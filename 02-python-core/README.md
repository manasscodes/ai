# 🐍 Core Python Programming for AI

This folder contains **structured notes, notebooks, and practice** for Python programming tailored toward building a strong base in writing clean, efficient, and modular code for AI workflows.

It serves as a **revision + deepening** track for Python essentials with a focus on logic building, object-oriented programming, and hands-on problem solving.

## 📘 Why Revise Python?

Even if you're experienced in Python, revisiting core programming helps improve:

* Code readability
* Logic building and debugging
* Interview preparedness
* Structuring reusable, testable AI code

---

## 📚 Topics Breakdown

### 1. ✅ Python Basics

* Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
* Variables and dynamic typing
* Type casting, `input()`, `print()`

### 2. ✅ Control Flow

* `if`, `elif`, `else`
* `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`
* `range()`, `enumerate()`
* List/dict/set comprehensions

### 3. ✅ Functions

* Function definitions, returns
* Default and keyword arguments
* `*args` and `**kwargs`
* Lambda expressions

### 4. ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Classes and objects
* Constructors and attributes
* Inheritance and method overriding
* Dunder methods: `__str__`, `__init__`, etc.

### 5. ✅ Modules & Packages

* `import`, `from` syntax
* Writing custom modules
* Virtual environments and `requirements.txt`

### 6. ✅ Error Handling

* `try-except-finally`
* Raising exceptions
* Using `assert` statements
* Debugging practices

### 7. ✅ File Handling

* `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `with` block
* Working with `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`
* Directory navigation with `os` module

### 8. ✅ Programming Projects (CLI / Logic-Based)

* Mini CLI apps (e.g., calculator, todo manager)
* File renamer, log parser, random password generator
* Pattern detection, data cleaning scripts

### 9. ✅ Utility Libraries

* `random`, `math`, `datetime`, `itertools`, `os`, `sys`
* `timeit` and performance measuring

## 🧪 Practice and Projects

You’ll find Jupyter Notebooks inside the `notebooks/` folder to practice each topic. Each notebook:

* Starts with short notes
* Has 10–20 coding tasks
* Ends with an applied CLI or scripting mini project (where possible)

---

## 🧠 Interview Prep Focus

Important concepts for interviews:

* List vs Tuple vs Set vs Dictionary
* Mutable vs Immutable
* Pass by reference/value
* OOP in Python
* Comprehensions
* Error handling
* Algorithmic thinking

These will be marked with 🧠 inside notes for easy revision.

---

## ✍️ How I Use This

* Write notes on paper + edit each `.md`
* Practice each notebook from scratch
* Push checkpoints weekly to GitHub
* Link to core concepts from AI folders
